Prelaunchr
==========

Originally open sourced over on our [engineering blog](http://engineering.harrys.com/2014/07/21/dont-launch-crickets.html), and discussed in great detail over at [Tim Ferriss' Blog](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/07/21/harrys-prelaunchr-email), Prelaunchr is a skeleton Rails application for quickly starting a viral prelaunch campaign for new companies or products. The campaign is conducive to social sharing and has prize levels based on the number of people each person refers. By default, we've included our original HTML/CSS for both the site and email to give you a better idea of how this looked when actually running.

## Mechanics

Prelaunchr has a main mechanic from which everything else is derived: Every `User` is given a unique `referral_code` which is how the application knows who referred a signing up user. Based on the amount of referrals a `User` has brought to the site, they are put into a different "prize group". The groups, amounts, and prizes are completely up to you to set.

## IP Blocking

By default, we block more than 2 sign-ups from the same IP address. This was simplistic, but was good enough for us during our campaign. If you want something more substantial take a look at [Rack::Attack](https://github.com/kickstarter/rack-attack)

## Setup

The [master branch](https://github.com/harrystech/prelaunchr/tree/master) of prelaunchr uses Rails 3.2.x. A Rails 4 compatible branch [exists as rails_4](https://github.com/harrystech/prelaunchr/tree/rails_4).

Follow the standard setup tasks documented at the Rails Github Repo depending on whether you are using
[Rails 3.2.x](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v3.2.17) or [Rails 4](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/v4.1.4).
Essentially this involves running `bundle install` in this repo directory.

* Run `bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load db:seed` to setup the database
* Type `bundle exec rails s` to startup the Rails Server
  * For convenience we have also bundled a Heroku Procfile to use on production. This uses [Unicorn](https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn) for the web server and runs a [Delayed::Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) worker for sending email.

## Teardown

When your prelaunch campaign comes to an end we've included a helpful `rake` task to help you compile the list of winners into CSV's containing the email addresses and the amount of referrals the user had.

* Run `bundle exec rake prelaunchr:create_winner_csvs` and the app will export CSV's in `/lib/assets` corresponding to each prize group.

## Configuration

* Change the default Admin user credentials in `/db/seeds.rb`
* Set the different prize levels on the `User::REFERRAL_STEPS` constant inside `/app/models/user.rb`
* Run `rake secret` to generate a new Rails `secret_token` and set it in `/config/initializers/secret_token.rb` (or in the `RAILS_SECRET` environment variable).
* The `config.ended` setting in `/config/application.rb` decides whether the prelaunch campaign has ended or not (e.g. Active/Inactive). We've included this option so you can quickly close the application and direct users to your newly launched site.
